# GameplayTags Component

This component contains Gameplay Tags. Add it to your Actors in which you want to use Gameplay Tags. You can then use the universal functions to manage (adding or removing) Gameplay Tags in Actors or check (one or more) those Tags. Those functions don't care whether the Actors have this Component or not, they work similarly to events for Interfaces. Examples of uses on the third slide in the Gallery.

> *This plugin does not work with the engine's built in Gameplay Tag Asset Interface!*
